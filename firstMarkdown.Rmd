# Celebrity Deaths in 2016
This is my first R Markdown document and it is about Celebrity Deaths in 2016.
*sad topic to analyze*

``` {r message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(readxl)
```

* First read the files you want to analyze
``` {r results = 'hide', warning = FALSE}
deaths <- read_excel("/Users/hazelkavili/Desktop/celebrityDeaths/celebrity_deaths_2016.xlsx", sheet = 1, col_names = TRUE)
```

* Attach variables to call easily
``` {r results = 'hide'}
attach(deaths)
```

* Make a histogram of the ages when they died

```{r fig.height = 4, fig.width = 5, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(deaths, aes(x = age)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 10) + xlab("Age of celebrities") +
  ylab("Frequency") + ggtitle("The age of celebrities when they died") + theme_bw()
```
